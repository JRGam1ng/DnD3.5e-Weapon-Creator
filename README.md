# DnD3.5e-Weapon-Creator
This is the Tkinter version of my Random Weapon Creator, meaning it has a GUI instead of text based.

This version of the Random Weapon Creator has a GUI and is coded for use with pictures.  I did not include the images as I do not own them, so you can either create your own or go without them, though that will require some adjustments to code.

You get the option of either Ranged or Melee weapon, Exotic or Standard, whether you want it to be a Masterworked weapon, and if you want the chance of an enchant.

It has a database attached with the list of weapons I have included, so that you can recall weapons based on name or damage. There is a commit option to the database so you can add your own weapons!
